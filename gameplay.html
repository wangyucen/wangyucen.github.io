<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>When a battle begins, units at the front of your board will fight against the units on the front of your enemy's board.Units move towards their first</br> 
target, typically the closest enemy.</p>
<p>Assassin Class units will attempt to jump far into the back lines and then target the closest enemy.</p>
<p>High HP units such as knights should be kept in the front row to absorb damage from enemy units.</p>
<p>Units with directional spells should be kept to one side or another to maximize the number of units they may hit.</p>
<p>Units with AoE damaging spells should be kept close to the middle of the board to maximize the number of units they may hit</p>
