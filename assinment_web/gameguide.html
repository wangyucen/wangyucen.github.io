 <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
 <p>The game of Autochess is an 8-player PvP game mode in Dota 2 based around an 8 by 8 chess board, where the individual chess pieces are Dota   </br>
 2 heroes.Each round, every player gets a random set of heroes from a limited pool to choose from and place on their side of the the board (4 by 8).</p>
 <p>The players are then matched against each other (or against neutral creeps every 5 rounds) where the chess pieces battle against each other </br>
 automatically.If a player loses the battle, he then loses 1 health points from each enemy hero left on the board (2 or 3 if the enemy hero is </br>
 powerful).The game is won when only one player is still standing.</p>

 <h2 id="basicgameplay">Basic Gameplay</h2>
 <p>On the start of a round, each player will get 5 random heroes to chose from, you can then buy which ever hero you want in exchange for gold. </br>
 The bought hero will be placed on the reserve slots of your board, you can then move it to wherever you want on your side of the board. Only one</br>
 hero can occupy a single tile.</p>
<p>The number of heroes on the board is limited to the player level, each round rewards the player with 1 exp, the player can alternatively spend </br>
5 gold to earn extra 4 xp. The player can also spend 2 gold to re-roll the 5 heroes that they get to chose from.</p>
<p>Gold is earned at the start of each round from 4 sources:</br>
Basic income for each round;</p>
<p>1 gold for beating the enemy;</p>
<p>Win or lose streak (up to 3 gold);</p>
<p>Interest (10%).</p>
<p>Interest is earned based on the amount of gold you currently have, and is always a rounded down number. So if you have 6 gold at the start of each</br>
 round, you get 0 interest (10% of 6 is 0.6 which is rounded down to 0). If you have 10 gold you get 1 interest, if you have 15 gold you get 1 interest,</br>
 20 gold you get 2 interest and so on. The max interest is 5 gold.</p>
 <p>Every hero starts with one star, it represent its level. If you place 3 equal heroes on the board, you get one hero with one higher star (with the </br>
 exception of druid), up to 3 stars. Heroes with higher stars have more health, damage and upgraded abilities</p>
 <p>Every hero has at least one specie, one class and one ability. Abilities are unique to the hero and work like a normal DotA 2 ability. Active abilities</br>
 require mana, which is earned every time the hero hits or gets hit by another unit. Species and classes are shared among the other heroes, there are 13 </br>
 species and 12 classes which combined makes for all the heroes in the game mode. Every specie and class has a synergy when combined with another unit of</br>
 the same class/specie (with the exception of ogre,demon, element, dwarf and demon hunter). For example, hunters have a 25% damage bonus if there are 3 </br>
 different hunters on the board, 35% if there are 6 different hunters.</p>
 <p>The first 3 rounds are also fought against creeps, which can give the player items when killed.</p>
 <p>A player can only hold a finite number of heroes on the board (8 on the reserve slots + number of heroes based on your level on the board). So the </br>
 player must manage the space they have in order to upgrade heroes to a higher level. Heroes can be sold for the same amount of gold when bought. If the</br>
 player starts the round with more heroes than their limit, one hero is automatically sold.</p>
 <p>There's a shared limited pool of heroes each game. There are only 20 pieces of each hero, so if someone in the game has a lot of some heroes, you're less</br>
 likely to get those heroes. The strategy is to keep track of what types of heroes your enemies are buying and buy lesser used heroes, or even buying heroes</br>
 to deny the opponents from getting them.</p>

 <h2 id="tipsandtricks">Tips and Tricks</h2>
 <p>Learn all the combo effects and synergies to utilise the chesses.</p>
 <p>Determine your team combos (Ex: Goblin - Assassin, Knight - Troll, Warrior, Marge, etc...). You should change your build depending on the situation (Ex:</br>
 If you want to go Goblin - Assassin build but 2 or 3 people are building that team/Your rolls are pretty bad and have a lot of unnecessary cheeses - You </br>
 should change to another combo).</p>
 <p>Buy things you need to buy for your future team. You can buy some heroes that is not for the combo you wanted but can help you survive early game, and </br>
 can sell it later.</p>
 <p>From round 7 you must not buy anything unless its really necessary,if you do that, in round 14 you will have 50 golds to maximum the interest golds each </br>
 round (+5 gold), you will have a really good economy afterward to build your team. Don’t let your gold drop below 50.</p>
 <p>In early game you shouldn't roll.</p>
 <p>In mid game you should roll max is 3 times for 1 round to not hurting your economy. The rest of gold should go for leveling up your courier.</p>

 <p>In late game spend all your gold for courier to level max and rolls for last pieces of combo you need.</p>
 <h2 id="wal">Winstreaks and Losestreaks</h2>
 <p>After winning 3 non-creep rounds in a row, your start earns +1 additional gold at the end of the turn. Keeping the win streak can get you up to +3 gold. </br>
 Creep rounds do not affect your win/loss streaks.</p>
 <p>Same applies for loss streaks.</p>
